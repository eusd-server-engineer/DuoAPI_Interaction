# DuoAPI Interaction Project - Final Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project provides automated tools for managing Duo Security users, with a special focus on student account cleanup and bypass management.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Web Dashboard** (`http://localhost:5000`)
- **Statistics Summary** - Live metrics from Duo API
  - Total students in Duo
  - Cleanup operations performed
  - Success rate percentage
  - Last operation timestamp

- **Bypass Management Interface**
  - Search users by username
  - View color-coded status (Active/Bypass/Disabled/Locked)
  - Update bypass status with confirmation
  - Complete audit trail logging
  - Toast notifications for feedback

- **Cleanup Operations**
  - Dry run and production modes
  - Progress tracking with real-time logs
  - CSV export of results
  - Backup before deletion

### 2. **Autonomous GitHub Monitoring**
- **GitHub Issue Monitor** (`scripts/github_monitor.py`)
  - Detects @claude mentions in issues
  - Tracks workflow failures
  - Creates pending work files
  - Runs via scheduled task every 5 minutes

- **Autonomous Action System** (`scripts/autonomous_action.py`)
  - Processes pending work items
  - Creates feature branches
  - Generates work instructions
  - Attempts to invoke Claude agents (requires manual execution)
  - Email notifications for assignments

### 3. **Successfully Implemented Issues**
- ✅ **Issue #3**: Color scheme improvements
- ✅ **Issue #7**: Workflow monitoring
- ✅ **Issue #9**: Statistics summary card
- ✅ **Issue #10**: Bypass management interface

## 🔑 Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Duo API Credentials
DUO_IKEY=your_integration_key
DUO_SKEY=your_secret_key
DUO_HOST=api-XXXXXXXX.duosecurity.com

# Dashboard Credentials
DASHBOARD_USER=admin
DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=admin123

# GitHub Token (for monitoring)
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx

# Email Settings (optional)
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your_email@domain.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@domain.com
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Configure environment:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your API credentials

3. **Start the dashboard:**
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/web_dashboard.py
   ```
   Access at: `http://localhost:5000`

4. **Run cleanup (dry run):**
   - Click "Run Dry Run" in dashboard
   - Review results before production run

## 🤖 Autonomous Workflow Status

### What Works:
- ✅ Scheduled monitoring detects GitHub issues
- ✅ Creates branches and work instructions
- ✅ Email notifications sent
- ✅ Agent execution via Task tool (when Claude Code is active)

### Limitations:
- ❌ Cannot fully run autonomously without human involvement
- ❌ Claude SDK requires CLI installation for subprocess execution
- ❌ Agent execution needs Claude Code to be actively running

### Semi-Autonomous Operation:
1. Scheduled tasks detect work → Create branches → Send notifications
2. Human reviews pending work
3. Human (or Claude Code) manually invokes agents via Task tool
4. Agents implement solutions → Create PRs

## 📊 Database Schema

### `operations` Table
- Tracks all cleanup operations
- Stores results, logs, and statistics

### `bypass_audit` Table
- Comprehensive audit trail for bypass management
- Records all lookups and status changes
- Includes user, timestamp, IP, and success/failure

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Authentication Required** - Basic auth for dashboard access
2. **Audit Logging** - All bypass operations logged
3. **Environment Variables** - Credentials not hardcoded
4. **HMAC Signing** - Secure Duo API authentication
5. **Input Validation** - Server-side validation of all inputs

## 🚦 Next Steps & Future Enhancements

### Immediate Improvements:
1. **Bulk Operations** - Update multiple users at once
2. **Export Features** - CSV export of audit logs
3. **Advanced Search** - Filter by status, enrollment date
4. **Scheduled Reports** - Weekly bypass status reports

### Long-term Enhancements:
1. **Active Directory Integration** - Sync with AD groups
2. **Role-Based Access Control** - Different admin levels
3. **WebSocket Updates** - Real-time status changes
4. **Mobile Interface** - Responsive design improvements

### Workflow Automation:
1. **API-Based Agents** - Use Anthropic API directly for full automation
2. **Approval Workflow** - Human review before PR merge
3. **Test Automation** - Automated testing before deployment
